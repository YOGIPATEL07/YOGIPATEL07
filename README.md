Welcome to My Digital Workspace! 🚀

Hi there! I'm Yogi Patel, an enthusiastic IT Professional with a knack for delivering technical solutions and a passion for creating impactful, user-centric applications. My journey in tech is driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to continuous learning.

🌟 What I Bring to the Table

With over three years of experience in IT support and service desk operations, I’ve had the privilege of working with diverse teams and tackling a wide range of technical challenges. At Bill Gosling Outsourcing, I provided technical support to over 5,000 users, achieving a 98% first-contact resolution rate. Whether it’s troubleshooting complex systems like Active Directory, VPN, or Citrix, or creating detailed knowledge base articles, I thrive on delivering solutions that work.

During my time at Georgian College IT Department, I honed my skills in managing large-scale system installations (1,200+ systems), automating repetitive tasks to streamline operations, and providing stellar customer service with a 4.9/5 satisfaction rating. These experiences not only deepened my technical expertise but also reinforced my passion for helping users and optimizing workflows.
